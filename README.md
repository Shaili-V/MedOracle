# MedOracle: AI-Powered Symptom-Based Disease Predictor
This is a Streamlit-based AI web application that predicts diseases based on user-input symptoms using a machine learning model trained on a healthcare dataset.

## Try It Online
- [Launch MedOracle on Streamlit Cloud](#) *(link coming soon)*

## Features
- **Symptom Autocomplete Input**
    - Users select from 237 predefined symptoms using a convenient autofill search feature

- **AI-Powered Predictions**
    - Outputs the top 3 most likely diseases with confidence levels using a trained Random Forest model

- **Detailed Disease Information**
    - For each of the 3 predicted diseases, users can view:
        - Description
        - Common medications and treatment
        - Severitly Level (color coded with triage key)
        - Contagiousness status

- **Severity Color Coding**
    - Emergency (ðŸ”´), Urgent (ðŸŸ ), Moderate (ðŸŸ¡), Mild (ðŸŸ¢)

- **Fully Responsive Interface**
    - Polished and effective UI utilizes Streamlit's titles, columns, buttons

- **Sidebar Instructions & Medical Disclaimer**
    - Enhances usability and transparency for users by explaining the application and attaching an alphabetized list of the available symptoms

## ðŸ“Š How It Works

1. **Symptom Selection**
   - Users select relevant symptoms via autocomplete input
2. **Prediction Engine**
   - A binary vector of symptoms is passed into a trained Random Forest model
3. **Top 3 Predictions**
   - Returned in order of probability with clickable info cards
4. **Disease Info Cards**
   - Show description, medication, severity, and contagiousness
